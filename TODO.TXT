2.1 Disc Label
CD-ROM XA discs require the presence of an identical CD-ROM XA disc
label in all copies of the Primary Volume Descriptor. The label
is located at offset 1024 of the Primary Volume Descriptor (byte
position 1025) and the format of the label is:
CD-ROM XA LABEL
BP Field Name Content
1025 - 1032 Identifying Signature 'CD-XA001'
1033 - 1034 CD-ROM XA Flags
1035 - 1042 Startup Directory d-characters1 or all
0's
1043 - 1050 Reserved 0's

Table 14 - Track Type interpretation
Bit Interpretation
0 If set to ZERO, the track shall not contain any sector with the Mode 0 attribute (3/A.1). If set to ONE,
the track shall contain only sectors with the Mode 0 attribute (3/A.1).
1 If set to ZERO, the track shall not contain any sector with the Mode 1 attribute (3/A.1). If set to ONE,
the track shall contain only sectors with the Mode 1 attribute (3/A.1).
2 If set to ZERO, the track shall not contain any sector with the Mode 2 attribute (3/A.1). If set to ONE,
the track shall contain only sectors with the Mode 2 attribute (3/A.1). If either bit 0 or bit 1 is set to
ONE, bit 2 shall be set to ZERO.
3 If set to ZERO, the track shall not contain any sector with the Mode 2 Form 1 attribute (3/A.1). If set to
ONE, the track may contain sectors with the Mode 2 Form 1 attribute (3/A.1) and bit 2 of this field
shall be set to ONE. If either bit 0 or bit 1 is set to ONE, bit 3 shall be set to ZERO.
4 If set to ZERO, the track shall not contain any sector with the Mode 2 Form 2 attribute (3/A.1). If set to
ONE, the track may contain sectors with the Mode 2 Form 2 attribute (3/A.1) and bit 2 of this field
shall be set to ONE. If either bit 0 or bit 1 is set to ONE, bit 4 shall be set to ZERO.
5-8 These four bits shall be interpreted as a 4 bit binary number as follows:
0 shall mean that the track is read-only and not available for recording.
1 shall mean that the track is write-once and may be available for recording.
2-15 are reserved for future standardisation.
9 If set to ZERO, the track shall be recorded in track-at-once mode and bits 10 and 11 shall be ZERO. If
set to ONE, the track shall be recorded in incremental mode and exactly one of bits 10 and 11 shall be
ONE.
10 If set to ZERO, the track shall not be recorded with fixed-length packets. If set to ONE, the track shall
be recorded with fixed-length packets, and bit 9 shall be set to ONE and bit 11 shall be set to ZERO.
11 If set to ZERO, the track shall not be recorded with variable-length packets. If set to ONE, the track
shall be recorded with variable-length packets, and bit 9 shall be set to ONE and bit 10 shall be set to
ZERO.
12-15 Reserved for future standardisation and shall be set to ZERO.
